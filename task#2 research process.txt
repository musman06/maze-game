1.) used extensively Three.js documentation as well as React Fiber documentation to implement the various functionalities of the game
    Three.js documentation: https://threejs.org/manual/#en/fundamentals
    React Fiber documentation: https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction

2.) read the fundamentals article on three.js documentation and implemented the code in it using React Fiber documentation. Fundamentals section helped me with most of the basic
    fundamentals of three.js such as primitives, mesh, material, textures, lights, cameras etc.

3.) collision detection using bounding boxes
